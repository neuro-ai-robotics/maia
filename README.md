### Summary

MAIA is a **control-oriented modular architecture** modeling the developmental progression of the **minimal self** in embodied synthetic agents. It is grounded in *foundational inductive biases*—formalized through active inference and shaped by sensorimotor interaction.

Evaluation is performed in a goal-directed continuous control task designed to expose emergent self-related capabilities under perturbations. This unified paradigm aligns biological and synthetic agents through a shared action-effect structure: a visible goal and a hidden actuator chain.

The architecture comprises three consolidation routes that coordinate minimal agentive organization, tracing the full arc of agency and delineating the emergence of the self, understood as the most primitive form of autonomy.

By isolating the essential functional components of control, we show that self-related organization can be both implemented and implicitly measured—offering a principled path toward synthetic autonomy with relevance across species.
